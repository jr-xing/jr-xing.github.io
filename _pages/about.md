Hi, I'm Jiarui (Jerry) Xing, currently a PhD candidate at University of Virginia. My research advances medical image analysis through innovative deep learning techniques, focusing on multimodal learning to integrate diverse imaging modalities and motion-based analysis to leverage crucial motion information beyond static images. These approaches are applied to tasks such as multimodal cardiac motion video generation with latent diffusion models, multimodal cardiac dyssynchrony estimation, and multitask myocardial scar segmentation. My work primarily centers on cardiac imaging applications, with potential extensions to other areas.
